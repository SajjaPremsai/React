    # weather
       This application is done by using React and Fetch api i used out sources like rapid api 
       and openweather api and you can check what are the componets are i used to create this. 
       In this i am showing three areas weather in that two are immutable which means you cannot change 
       Latitude and Longitude and another one is mutable.And the Api is takes only 5 request per sec.
